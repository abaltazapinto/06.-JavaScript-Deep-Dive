The primary differences between arrays and objects in JavaScript are:

1. **Structure**:
   - **Arrays**: Ordered collections of items, indexed numerically.
   - **Objects**: Unordered collections of key-value pairs, indexed by keys (strings or symbols).

2. **Use Cases**:
   - **Arrays**: Best for lists or sequences of items, where the order matters.
   - **Objects**: Ideal for storing data with named properties, such as configuration settings or records.

3. **Methods**:
   - **Arrays**: Have methods like `push`, `pop`, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.
   - **Objects**: Accessed using keys, and manipulated with methods like `Object.keys`, `Object.values`, and `Object.entries`.

Arrays are used for ordered data, while objects are used for key-value pairs.
