Intoduction to Asynchronous JavaScript and Network requests

IN javascript, asyncronous operations allow you to perform tasks sucha as fetching data from a server without freexing the entire application., This is a crucial for creating smooth , responsive web applications. One of the ,most common asyncronous operations inJavaScript is making network resquests o APIs.

**Key Concepts**
1. **Asyncronous Programming: This involves writing code that can perform tasks in the background without blocking the main thread** Javascript achieves this using callbacks, promises, and async/await.
2. **Callbcks: ** Function passed as arguments to other functions, executed afteer an asynchronous operation has completed.
3. **Promises:** Objects representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an aynchronous operation and its resulting value.
4. Async/Await: Syntatic sugar over promises, providing a more readable and syncronous-looking way to write asyncronous code.

**Network Requests**
Network requests in Javascript are commonly made using the Fetch API, which return a promise that resolves to the response of the request.

Fetch API 

The Fetch API provides an esay way to fetch resources across the network. Here's the basic syntax:

```
fetch(url, options)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(error => console.error('Error: ', error));
```
