`event.stopPropagation()` is a method used in event handling in JavaScript to stop the event  from propagating (bubling) up the DOM tree. When an event is fired on an element, it normally propagates up to its parent elements unless `event.stopPropagation()` is called.

**event propagation**
Event propagation consist of two main phases: 

1. Capturing Phase (Tricle Down): The event starts from the root and goes down to the target element.
2. **Bubling Phase (Bubble Up) ** The event starts from the target element and bubles up to the root.

**Example Scenario**
Suppose you have a nested structure of elements, and you attach event listeners to both the parent and child elements. Without stopping propagation, an event on the child will trigger both the child's and the parenet's event listeners.

Example Code
Consider the following HTML:

html
Copy code
<div id="parent">
    <button id="child">Click Me</button>
</div>
And the following JavaScript:

javascript
Copy code
document.getElementById('parent').addEventListener('click', () => {
    alert('Parent clicked');
});

document.getElementById('child').addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    alert('Child clicked');
    event.stopPropagation();  // Stops the event from bubbling up to the parent
});
Explanation
When you click the button (#child), it will trigger the click event on the button.
The button's event listener will execute and show the alert "Child clicked".
The event.stopPropagation() method will stop the event from propagating to the parent element.
As a result, the parent element's event listener will not be triggered, and you will not see the alert "Parent clicked".
Without stopPropagation()
If you remove event.stopPropagation() from the child's event listener, both alerts ("Child clicked" and "Parent clicked") will be shown because the event bubbles up to the parent.

Practical Use Case
You would use event.stopPropagation() when you have nested elements and you want to prevent the parent elements from responding to an event triggered by a child element. This is particularly useful in complex interfaces where different layers of components handle events differently, and you want to control which components respond to which events.

Summary
Purpose: Prevents an event from bubbling up the DOM tree.
Use Case: When you want to restrict event handling to a specific element and its handler.
Method: event.stopPropagation()
Hereâ€™s a simple demonstration of using event.stopPropagation() in an event handler:

javascript
Copy code
document.getElementById('child').addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    alert('Child clicked');
    event.stopPropagation(); // Stops the event from propagating to the parent
});
This will ensure that the click event on the child element does not trigger the parent element's event handler.
